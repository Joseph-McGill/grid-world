## Grid World using Reinforcement Learning

This is a simple grid world implementation in Python. In the grid world, a
learning agent must navigate the terrain using reinforcement learning
techniques to determine the optimal route to the goal state. The reinforcement
learning techniques implemented here are [Q-Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) and [SARSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-Action-Reward-State-Action).

To view the results of a single trial of Q-Learning and SARSA, see the [docs](../master/docs) folder.
